To use Git and GitHub, you need:

A desktop computer with Git installed on it (see the Git downloads page).
A tool to use Git. Depending on how you like to work, you could use a Git GUI client (we'd recommend GitHub Desktop, SourceTree or Git Kraken) or just stick to using a terminal window. In fact, it is probably useful for you to get to know at least the basics of git terminal commands, even if you intend to use a GUI.
A GitHub account. If you haven't already got one, sign up now using the provided link.
